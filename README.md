# VideoMAE Model: Training on UCF101 Dataset

Welcome to the repository for training the VideoMAE (State-of-the-art Video Classifier) model on a subset of the UCF101 Dataset. This repository provides a comprehensive notebook that guides you through the process of training the VideoMAE model, enabling accurate video classification.
## Overview

The VideoMAE model is a powerful video classifier designed to assign a single label or class to an entire video. By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques, it accurately categorizes videos based on their content, allowing for various applications such as action recognition or activity tracking.

## Dataset
This repository focuses on training the VideoMAE model using a subset of the UCF101 Dataset. The UCF101 Dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset in the field of video classification. It consists of videos spanning 101 different action categories, providing a diverse and challenging dataset for training video classifiers. The subset used in this repository offers a representative collection of videos to train the VideoMAE model effectively.

## Requirements
To successfully run the notebook and train the VideoMAE model, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.8
- datasets
- pytorchvideo
- evaluate 
- torch 
- decord
- transformers==4.28.0

Ensure that these dependencies are installed before proceeding with the training process.

## Contributions
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to extend the functionality of the VideoMAE model, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
